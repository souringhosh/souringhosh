### 🏃 Hyperlapse & Motion Sports Projects
- **Table Tennis Stroke Prediction**:
This is a work towards developing a wearable Body Sensor Network(BSN) for Table Tennis(TT) stroke detection through self-learned features. By capturing acceleration and rotation parameters using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors mounted on the player forearm and shoulder while playing a TT stroke, a neural network has been trained to predict forehand and backhand shots. The model runs on Arduino Nano 33 BLE and achieves a real-time prediction accuracy of 90.7%.

### 🧪 Biomedical & Signal Projects

- **Leukocyte Classification using Watershed + Distance Transform**
- **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Detection**  
  Image-based detection of blood cancer using peripheral blood smears.  
  📄 [Publication (IEEE)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7087834/)

- **ECG Compression using Differential Edge + RLE**
  A new approach to compress the ECG signal through Run Length Encoding (RLE). Instead of directly applying RLE to the ECG signal, it has been applied to the edge transitions of the PQRST cycle difference taken at each consecutive sample. The algorithm gives us better compression ratios than conventional RLE based approaches and also enables us to retrieve the signal with a low PRD of 1.32% and a high SNR of 78.65 dB.

- **Audio Compression using FFT of WAV Files**  
  C++ based spectrum analyzer that discards high-frequency content for lossy compression.
