### 5. Hyperlapse Photography

### 6. Leucocyte classification for leukaemia detection using image processing techniques

### 7. Differential Edge based ECG Compression using RLE

### 1. FFT based audio compression of .wav Audio Files
This project involved writing a C++ application to perform fourier analysis of an audio file, specifically an audio file created with a WAVE format. The code would parse the file, extract the header and data bytes, separately. The header extraction is important because WAVE encoding information is stored in the header. Then, it performs a 1024 bit Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) operation on the data stream. Since human ear is not sensitive towards high frequency content, the code scraps the high frequency bits and rewrites the data stream into a new audio file. Thus the code is effectively able to show a signal compression based on the portion of HF content in the input audio file.

### 2. Prototype design for Smart Wearable Footwear
