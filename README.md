## Projects:
### High Speed Photography

>The camera: [Phantom Flex v311](http://www.phantomhighspeed.com/)

1 M.Tech Dissertation:

>As a part of COEP E&TC Department's Centre for Image Analysis, I collaborated with the Dept. of Metallurgy and Material Sciences for analysing the Melt Pool during Laser Cladding and Sintering processes using High speed photography. 
An image processing based analysis method was proposed through parameteric variations of laser on the build quality of
laser cladded and sintered products.

2 Schlieren Flow Visualization:

>This project involved using High Speed Photography to visualize sound waves. An optics based experiment was designed to study transmission of sound waves through air. For this, high impulse sounds(like cracker gunshots) were produced and High speed videos were recorded at 40.000 fps and we could observe visually observe how the waves travel. 
See Demo

3 Assignments for Arvind Gupta Toys:

>[Arvind Gupta - An Engineer who creates Toys](http://www.ted.com/talks/arvind_gupta_turning_trash_into_toys_for_learning#t-913222)

>During a small research exploration at the [IUCAA](www.iucaa.ernet.in/) we stumbled across the small office of this immensely popular man and recorded high speed videos of few of the simple experiments that he so beautifully explains in his videos. Our videos provide a slow motion insight into the world of science through these toys.

### Hyperlapse Photography

### A Watershed distance transform based leucocyte classification for leukaemia detection

### Detection of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia(ALL) using image processing
>Developed as a part of B.Tech project, this application aims at classification of blood cancer through image based analysis of peripheral blood.

### Differential Edge based ECG Compression using RLE

### FFT based audio compression of .wav Audio Files
>This project involved writing a C++ application to perform fourier analysis of an audio file, specifically an audio file created with a WAVE format. The code would parse the file, extract the header and data bytes, separately. The header extraction is important because WAVE encoding information is stored in the header. Then, it performs a 1024 bit Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) operation on the data stream. Since human ear is not sensitive towards high frequency content, the code scraps the high frequency bits and rewrites the data stream into a new audio file. Thus the code is effectively able to show a signal compression based on the portion of HF content in the input audio file.
